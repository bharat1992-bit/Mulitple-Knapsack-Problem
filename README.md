PIRS3A.py solves the multiple knapsack problem using simulated annealing. 
INST1, INST2, INST3, INST4 are the 4 instances on which PIRS3A was tested. 
Instances should be read in this way ( global optimal value, number_of_items, Knapsack Capacity, weight cost)
ANOVA analysis is done in DoE to find the interactions between the four different hyperparameters of simulated annealing.
